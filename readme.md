# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model to predict **customer churn**, i.e., whether a customer will **stay with the company or leave**. Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

The project is divided into **three main components**:

1. **Model Training** – Building and training the ANN using a churn dataset.
2. **Model Prediction** – Using the trained model to predict customer behavior.
3. **Visualization & Deployment** – Deploying the model using **Streamlit** for interactive visualization and real-time predictions.

## 🧠 Model Training

* The churn dataset is preprocessed (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling).
* An **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** is designed using multiple dense layers.
* The model is trained on historical customer data to learn patterns associated with churn.
* Performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as **accuracy** and **loss**.

## 🔮 Model Prediction

* The trained ANN model is used to predict whether a customer will:

  * **Stay with the company**, or
  * **Leave the company (Churn)**
* Predictions are made on new/unseen customer data.
* The output is presented in a user-friendly format for easy interpretation.

## 📊 Visualization & Deployment (Streamlit)

* **Streamlit** is used to build an interactive web application.
* Users can input customer details through the UI.
* The app displays the churn prediction results instantly.
* This enables easy model demonstration and real-time usage without technical expertise.
